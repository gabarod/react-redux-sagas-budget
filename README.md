# React Redux Sagas Budget App 💰🚀

Welcome to the React Redux Sagas Budget App repository! This project is a demonstration of how to build a budget management application using React, Redux, Redux Sagas, and Semantic UI.

## About the Project 📝

This application is a practical implementation of a budget management system using modern web technologies. It's built with React for the user interface, Redux for state management, Redux Sagas for handling side effects, and Semantic UI for a sleek and intuitive user interface.

## Getting Started 🏁

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. 

## Available Scripts 💻

In the project directory, you can run several commands:

- `yarn start`: Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

- `yarn build`: Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

- `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `yarn eject`: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

- `yarn backend`: Runs the JSON server which provides a mock backend for the application.

- `yarn start:all`: Runs both the frontend and the backend concurrently.
